My current documents and code would not hold up the the reproduciblity test at this moment. However, this semester is the first time I have ever had code to document and make reproducible. Non-reproducibile research hinders computational biology and bioinformatics. Without properly documented code, computational biolgists would hardly reproduce the same outcome. Reproducing code is already hard enough as it is, so keeping well documented README files and properly commenting is a must to aid in maintaining a reproducible scientific community. In the field of medicine, reproducibility is extremely important, and someone's life will actually depend on it. This further iterates the importance to keep a well documented virtual notebook and to always keep computational biology and bioinformatics reproducible.

As I have no previous experience with code, I do not feel that my current projects would pass any reproducibility tests. This is my first exposure to using a repository host such as GitHub, so I am still working through how to take full advantage of what it offers. Without reproducibility, bioinformatics would struggle to develop as quickly as it has. Reproducibile content is crucial to collaboration which allows for more progress. When multiple people focused on a common goal can work on the same project in a frictionless way, strides can be made in finding new, important information.

My current documents are managed in Box. I download and upload revised files using my initials and a letter (A-Z) signifying the version I uploaded.
 This method has room for mistakes especially since not everyone in my lab utilizes it.
 They have their own style of addressing newer versions of documents. This can be a hassle when working on grants/big projects such as publications.
 I have a newfound appreciation for GitHub as it forces participants to acknowledge updates made by colleagues and allows for one to
 correct mistakes such as editing an older document that has been recently modified. Non reproducible code makes room
 for errors specifically if someone tries to recreate your project in a similar way but without using your code,they could get different results and contrast the findings in your study. 
This is a big issue in research where many studies that are recreated are marked as “non-reproducible”. 
This could be true but it could also be attributed to someone not sharing their code therefore allowing room for interpretation/errors by another lab/researcher that is trying to redo that same study.
 This is true for my field of study as well since I hope to study diet data. Differences in bioinformatics can lead to different conclusions.

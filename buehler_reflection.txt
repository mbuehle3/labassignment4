My current methodology for managing my code and work flow would not meet the standards for scientific reproducibility. 
I have not done much work with bioinformatic pipelines, but I do use phylogenetic software quite frequently, and I think one way that I could make my research  more open access even as a systematist, is to make the log files from the final runs of each analysis available on repository such as git.
Generally the log files contain sequence information, seed numbers, program version numbers, and any other parameter settings that were set. 
In some instances the whole alignment is included in the log file (beast files), but in the off change they are not including a file with the genbank accession numbers would make the research much more reproducible. 

If the researchers that create programs that accomplish specific and/or important tests don't make their code reproducible, or open access, then if any errors or bugs are found it becomes near impossible to detect where they came from. 
One of the most frustrating aspects of reading systematic papers is that sometimes the details of how analyses were executed are glossed over in the methods section. 
Also, supplementary files generally only contain the outputs of programs, but not the inputs, which, again, makes it difficult to reproduce the results.
